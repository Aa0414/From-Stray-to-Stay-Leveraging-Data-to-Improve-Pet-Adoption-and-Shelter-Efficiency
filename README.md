As pet companionship becomes increasingly important in modern life, the number of animals entering shelters continues to rise. This project aims to better understand adoption dynamics not only to support animal welfare, but also to uncover actionable insights that can guide resource planning, outreach strategy, and sustainable adoption programs.
This study analyzes Austin Animal Center intake and outcome data (2020–2025) to characterize shelter demand, animal populations, and outcome patterns using a cleaned, high-integrity dataset with a 98.4% intake–outcome match rate. Seasonal peaks in spring and summer indicate the need for adaptive staffing and medical capacity. Dogs and cats dominate the intake population, and dogs show a notably higher repeat-intake rate—more than three times that of cats—highlighting the importance of targeted behavioral or owner-support interventions to reduce repeated shelter cycling. Coat color significantly predicts adoption likelihood, with lighter or patterned animals exhibiting higher adoption rates. Outcome distributions confirm Austin’s strong no-kill performance, while length-of-stay varies widely by outcome type. Spatial analysis highlights concentrated stray hotspots along major roads in Austin and Travis County. These findings support data-driven improvements in resource allocation, adoption strategy, and future predictive modeling.
