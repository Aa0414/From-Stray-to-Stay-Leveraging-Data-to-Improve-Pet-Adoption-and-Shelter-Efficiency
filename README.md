Project Overview

As pet companionship becomes increasingly important in modern life, the number of animals entering shelters continues to rise. This project aims to better understand adoption dynamics, not only to support animal welfare but also to uncover actionable insights that can guide resource planning, outreach strategy, and sustainable adoption programs.

By analyzing intake and outcome data from the Austin Animal Center (2020–2025), this study characterizes shelter demand, animal populations, and outcome patterns. The dataset used is of high integrity, with a 98.4% intake–outcome match rate, providing a robust foundation for identifying trends and making data-driven recommendations.

Key Insights

Seasonal Peaks: Intake volumes peak during spring and summer, highlighting the need for adaptive staffing and medical capacity during these months.

Intake Populations: Dogs and cats dominate the intake population, with dogs showing a notably higher repeat-intake rate—more than three times that of cats. This suggests a need for targeted behavioral interventions and owner-support programs to reduce repeat shelter cycling.

Adoption Likelihood: Coat color significantly influences adoption rates. Lighter-colored or patterned animals tend to have higher adoption rates, offering valuable insights for targeted adoption campaigns.

No-Kill Performance: Austin Animal Center has a strong no-kill performance, but length-of-stay varies significantly by outcome type, indicating opportunities for optimizing adoption strategies.

Stray Hotspots: Spatial analysis reveals concentrated stray hotspots along major roads in Austin and Travis County, which could inform future outreach and resource allocation.

Data & Methodology

This analysis uses a cleaned, high-integrity dataset from the Austin Animal Center, covering the period from 2020 to 2025. The dataset includes detailed records of intake and outcome information, allowing for deep insights into shelter operations and trends.

Key data points include:

Animal intake records (species, breed, age, coat color, etc.)

Outcome records (adopted, returned, euthanized, etc.)

Spatial data for stray hotspots

Goals & Future Directions

The primary goal of this project is to support data-driven improvements in:

Resource Allocation: Understanding seasonal trends and specific shelter demands helps optimize staffing and medical resources.

Adoption Strategy: Insights into adoption likelihood and repeat-intake patterns can guide outreach and behavioral support efforts.

Predictive Modeling: Future work could focus on building predictive models to forecast shelter intake and outcomes, enabling proactive resource planning.
